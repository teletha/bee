/**
 * A simple built-in profiler for measuring the execution time of code blocks.
 *
 * <p>
 * This profiler uses a static collection to store timing records globally. It supports
 * nested profiling scopes using a try-with-resources pattern. The time reported for
 * a scope represents the "self-time" â€“ the time spent directly within that scope,
 * excluding time spent in nested (child) scopes.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Usage Example:
 * </p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Start profiling the "Data Processing" task
 * try (Profiling ignored = Profiling.of("Data Processing")) {
 *     // Code for data processing...
 *
 *     // Start profiling a sub-task "Validation"
 *     try (Profiling ignored2 = Profiling.of("Validation")) {
 *         // Code for validation...
 *         Thread.sleep(50); // Simulate work
 *     } // "Validation" scope ends here
 *
 *     // More data processing code...
 *     Thread.sleep(100); // Simulate work
 * } // "Data Processing" scope ends here
 *
 * // Later, display the results
 * Profiling.show(ui); // Assuming 'ui' is a UserInterface instance
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In the example above, the time reported for "Data Processing" will be approximately 100ms,
 * as the 50ms spent in "Validation" is excluded from its parent's self-time. The time
 * for "Validation" will be approximately 50ms.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: This profiler is designed for single-threaded usage scenarios or scenarios
 * where nesting occurs strictly within the same thread. The global state might lead
 * to incorrect nesting if {@code Profiling.of()} and {@code close()} calls are interleaved
 * across different threads without proper external synchronization. The collection of
 * results (`records`) is thread-safe.
 * </p>
